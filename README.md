# Diablo-II-Character-Editor---Custom-Hack-called-Jamella-II
JamellaTwo opens diablo 2 character files, and processes stats, spells, quests, and more. Language C++ and Win32.

# Summary
Jamella 2 is an unfinished Diablo II character editor which opens v1.09 Expansion character
format only. The name comes from another more popular character editor called Jamella. This project
employs heavy use of the Win32 API to render tabs, and images.

I did not do the investigating into the 1.09 character file format. Instead I relied on online resources for
the information inside of 'CharacterTables.h'.'

# Usage
Run the binary file included or compile the code. Run the application and choose open. Then
select the D2S file provided in the binary folder called 'TestCharacter.D2S'.
